##Program: simple for loop exercise: print the number of X as in the list given

numbers = [3,4,6,5]
for i in numbers:
        print(i*"x")
        
##OR another method

for i in numbers:
    output = ''
    for count in range(i):
        output += 'x'
    print(output)
    
#%%
# code to find the largest number in a list;
numbers = [2,5,7,6,5]
max = numbers[0]
for i in numbers:
    if i>max:
        max = i
print(max)
